<h1>Flight Computer</h1>

<p><b>Current PCB Revision:</b> 1.0</p>
<p><b>PCB Part Number:</b> A0007</p>

<p>The Avionics team aims to produce a dual-deploy flight computer 
 for use in high powered rocketry projects. The flight computer 
PCB uses an ARM Microcontroller to provide a computationally 
capable embedded protoyping platform for high powered rocketry projects 
with minimal wiring and a small form factor.</p>
