<h1>Flight Computer</h1>

<p>Current PCB Revision: 1.0</p>
<p>PCB Part Number: A0002</p>

<p>The Avionics team aims to produce a general purpose flight computer 
 for use in high powered rocketry projects that require an embedded processor
specialized for state estimation and control system implementation. The Avionics
flight computer PCB uses an ARM Microcontroller with embedded control and 
navigation sensors to provide a computationally capable embedded protoyping 
platform for high powered rocketry projects with minimal wiring and a small
 form factor.</p>
